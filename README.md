 This project demonstrates my SPSS skills in analyzing public perceptions of air pollution in urban Pakistan. Key findings include burning waste and deforestation as major causes, with 57% of concerns explained by these perceptions (RÂ² = 0.570). Robust regression and validation highlight my ability to derive actionable insights from data.
